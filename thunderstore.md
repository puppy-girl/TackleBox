# Tackle Box
A mod menu for WEBFISHING and config API for mod devs! ðŸŽ£

Adds a "Mods" button to the main and escape menus to view a list of the mods currently loaded by GDWeave. If a mod fails to load it will be separated and labelled by Tackle Box to aid in discovering problems with installed mods. Mods that come with additional config options will show a button to configure them, allowing you to enable/disable features of a mod or change a mod's behaviour without touching a json file!

Additionally, Tackle Box provides signals and methods for mod developers to more easily interact with and react to mod config files, offering a straightforward way for mods to show immediate updates in-game when their configs are updated

## For Mod Developers
Tackle Box can display additional metadata for loaded mods, such as its current version, author, and a brief description! To include richer metadata with your mod for Tackle Box to display, add a `"Metadata"` key to your `manifest.json` with the following value:
```json
{
    "Name": "The name of your mod",
    "Author": "Your name goes here~!",
    "Version": "Your mod's current version formatted as a string",
    "Description": "A brief description of your mod"
}
```
For an example of what your manifest should look like, check out [Tackle Box's manifest](https://github.com/puppy-girl/TackleBox/blob/main/manifest.json)!

Additionally, as of version 0.2.0, Tackle Box comes with additional utilities for developers to take advantage of. To use Tackle Box's utilities in your code, add the following to the top of your script:

`onready var TackleBox := $"/root/TackleBox"`

For Tackle Box to be available for your mod to use **make sure** you include `"TackleBox"` as a dependency in your mod's `manifest.json`!

### Signals

`signal mod_config_updated(mod_id, config) # mod_id: String, config: Dictionary`

- Emits a signal every time a mod's config is updated through Tackle Box's methods; this allows for mods to react to any changes made to config files immediately instead of only reading configs when the game launches!

#### Example:

```py
const MOD_ID = "my mod id"

var config: Dictionary

onready var TackleBox := $"/root/TackleBox"


func _ready() -> void:
    TackleBox.connect("mod_config_updated", self, "_on_config_update")


func _on_config_update(mod_id: String, new_config: Dictionary) -> void:
    if mod_id != MOD_ID: # Check if it's our mod being updated
        return
    
    if config.hash() == new_config.hash(): # Check if the config is different
        return
    
    config = new_config # Set the local config variable to the updated config

    # Update anything that needs updating here!
```

### Methods

`get_mod_manifest(mod_id: String) -> Dictionary`

- Returns the mod manifest for the given mod ID. Keys are returned in snake_case

`get_mod_metadata(mod_id: String) -> Dictionary`

- Returns the mod metadata for the given mod ID. Keys are returned in snake_case

`get_mod_config(mod_id: String) -> Dictionary`

- Returns the config for the given mod ID.

`set_mod_config(mod_id: String, new_config: Dictionary) -> int`

- Sets the config for the given mod ID and creates a new config file if one doesn't exist; returns an error code if unable to write to the config

#### Example

```py
const MOD_ID = "my mod id"

var config: Dictionary
var default_config: Dictionary = {}

onready var TackleBox := $"/root/TackleBox"


func _ready() -> void:
    _init_config()


func _init_config() -> void:
    var saved_config = TackleBox.get_mod_config(MOD_ID)

    for key in default_config.keys():
        if not saved_config[key]: # If the config property isn't saved...
            saved_config[key] = default_config[key] # Set it to the default
    
    config = saved_config
    TackleBox.set_mod_config(MOD_ID, config) # Save it to a config file!
```
